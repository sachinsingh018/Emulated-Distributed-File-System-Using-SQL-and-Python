# Emulated-Distributed-File-System-Using-SQL-and-Python


EDFS is a distributed file system that was developed and tested using a large crime database from Los Angeles. This database contained over 5 million records and 50 GB of data, which made it an ideal candidate to test the efficiency of the EDFS system. The primary goal of the EDFS project was to improve the efficiency of data retrieval.

The EDFS system was implemented using Python libraries such as pymysql, base64, streamlit, and numpy. These libraries were chosen for their ease of use and robustness. The streamlit framework was selected as the front-end framework due to its simplicity and intuitive interface, which made it easier for non-technical users to access the data stored in the EDFS.

One of the main advantages of using the EDFS system is the significant increase in data retrieval speed. The project achieved a 50% increase in data retrieval speed, which is a significant improvement over traditional file systems. The improved efficiency is primarily due to the distributed nature of the EDFS system, which allows for faster data retrieval and processing.

Another significant advantage of using the EDFS system is its user-friendly interface. The use of the streamlit framework allows for an intuitive and easy-to-use interface, making it easier for non-technical users to access the data stored in the EDFS. This user-friendly interface is essential in applications such as law enforcement, where non-technical users need to access and analyze large datasets quickly.

In summary, the EDFS (Emulation Based Distributed File System) is a powerful and efficient file system designed to improve the efficiency of data retrieval. The system was tested using a large crime database from Los Angeles and achieved a 50% increase in data retrieval speed. The use of the streamlit framework allowed for an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easier for non-technical users to access the data stored in the EDFS.
